## Introduction
Welcome to the Bellabeat data analysis case study! This case study is the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. In this project I have taken on the role of a junior data analyst at Bellabeat, a wellness company specializing in health-focused products for women. Through this case study, my goal is to gain insights into how consumers use Bellabeat's smart devices and identify key trends to help influence the company's marketing strategies. This project is designed to simulate a real-world analysis, working through the core steps of the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share,** and **Act.** 


## Scenario
As a junior data analyst at Bellabeat, I am tasked with helping the company uncover insights from smart device usage data. Bellabeat, a company focused on health and wellness products for women, is looking to understand how consumers engage with health-related technology. By analyzing trends from outside smart device usage, I will identify patterns that can be applied to Bellabeat's customer base. My goal is to provide data-driven insights that can guide patterns that can guide the marketing team in refining their strategies and connecting with their audience more effectively.
