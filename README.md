## Introduction
Welcome to the Bellabeat data analysis case study! This case study is the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. In this project I have taken on the role of a junior data analyst at Bellabeat, a wellness company specializing in health-focused products for women. Through this case study, my goal is to gain insights into how consumers use Bellabeat's smart devices and identify key trends to help influence the company's marketing strategies. This project is designed to simulate a real-world analysis, working through the core steps of the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share,** and **Act.**
